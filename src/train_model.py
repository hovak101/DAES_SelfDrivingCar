# The goal of this file is to: 
#   1. Define model: model.Sequential.blablabla
#   2. Use opencv or np to create np arrays from jpgs
#   3. Use pandas or np to extract data from csv and put into numpy array
#   4. Compile model and then train: model.fit(xs, ys, epochs="...")
#       a. xs should be (# of frames) * 1920 * 1080 * 3
#       b. ys should be (# of frames) * 4
